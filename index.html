  <h2>About Me</h2>
  <h3>Ph. D. in Landscape Ecology having research interest in ecosystem and climate modelling, GIS, Remote Sensing</h3>
  <p> I am a Senior Scientific Officer at the Department of Plant Resources, Ministry of Forests and Environment, Nepal. 
    My research focuses on vegetation ecology, ecosystem modeling, and geospatial analysis of environmental change in 
    the Himalayas. Dr. Khadka holds a Ph.D. in Landscape Ecology from the Vegetation Structure and Process Research Group, 
    School of Ecology and Environmental Sciences, Yunnan University, Kunming, China. His research focuses on ecosystem and 
    climate modeling, GIS, and remote sensing. He earned an M.Sc. in Botany from Tribhuvan University, Nepal, and a GFM 
    Diploma in GIS from the International Institute for Geo-Information Science and Earth Observation (ITC), The Netherlands. 
    With expertise in ecology, GIS, remote sensing, ethnobotany, and non-timber forest products (NTFPs) and medicinal and 
    aromatic plants (MAPs), Dr. Khadka currently works at the Ministry of Forests and Environment, Department of Plant 
    Resources, Nepal. He is actively involved in research on botany, ecology, and ethnobotany, particularly in the project 
    “Sustainable Management of Medicinal Plants using GIS and Remote Sensing.”</p>
