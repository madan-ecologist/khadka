  <h2>About Me</h2>
  <h3>Ph. D. in Landscape Ecology having research interest in ecosystem and climate modelling, GIS, Remote Sensing</h3>
  <p style="text-align: justify;"> Dr. Khadka is Senior Scientific Officer at the Department of Plant Resources, Ministry of Forests and Environment, Nepal. 
    His research focuses on vegetation ecology, ecosystem modeling, and geospatial analysis of environmental change in the Himalayas.</p> 
    
   <p style="text-align: justify;"> Dr. Khadka holds a Ph.D. in Landscape Ecology from the Vegetation Structure and Process Research Group, School of Ecology and 
      Environmental Sciences, Yunnan University, Kunming, China based on ecosystem and climate modeling, GIS,   
      and remote sensing. He earned an M.Sc. in Botany from Tribhuvan University, Nepal, and a GFM Diploma in GIS 
      from the International Institute for Geo-Information Science and Earth Observation (ITC), The Netherlands.</p> 

  <p style="text-align: justify;"> He has been actively involved in evaluating plant species habitat suitability under current and future climate scenarios,
applying advanced statistical and machine learning techniques for model validation and environmental decision support.
He has also contributed in forest fragmentation metrics, natural resource management, and participatory conservation 
     approaches that integrate local knowledge and scientific analysis.</p>
  
          <p style="text-align: justify;"> With expertise in ecology, GIS, remote sensing, ethnobotany, and non-timber forest products (NTFPs) and medicinal and 
    aromatic plants (MAPs), he is actively involved in research on botany, ecology, and ethnobotany, particularly in the project 
    “Sustainable Management of Medicinal Plants using GIS and Remote Sensing.” He is working in this area around 15 years in middle
management team. He also worked in above sectors in different rural locations of Nepal from east (Ilam) to west (Jumla). 
        During his experience, he found how these plants could contribute to livelihood of rural community's people
in Nepal. His major responsibilities is to conserve these valuable plants from exploitation.</p>
      <p style="text-align: justify;"> He has collaborated on research projects across different ecological zones in Nepal, contributing to national and academic
dialogues on conservation planning and policy. Currently, he is engaged in projects that emphasize ecosystem-based
adaptation and strategic conservation prioritization. </p>
